Hadoop MapReduce – Liquor Sales
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Hadoop MapReduce pipeline to process raw liquor sales data and transform it into a structured, analysis-ready format.

The goal was to extract insights from large-scale liquor sales records, including trends, totals, and patterns over time.

🛠 Technologies Used

Hadoop MapReduce

Java (or Python Streaming)

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

Data Cleaning & Transformation Techniques

ETL Design Principles

🔄 ETL Process
1️⃣ Extract

Ingested raw liquor sales data from CSV files stored in HDFS

2️⃣ Transform

Filtered invalid or incomplete records

Standardized date formats and product names

Aggregated sales by date, store, and product

Calculated key metrics (total sales, average sales, quantity sold)

3️⃣ Load

Stored transformed data back into HDFS in a structured format for analysis

📊 Key Outcomes

Scalable processing of large liquor sales datasets

Cleaned and aggregated data ready for analytics

Demonstrated ability to implement distributed ETL pipelines using Hadoop MapReduce

🚀 Why This Project Matters
