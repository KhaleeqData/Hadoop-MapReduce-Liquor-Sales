## 🔄 ETL Process

### 1️⃣ Extract
- Loaded raw liquor sales dataset from HDFS

### 2️⃣ Transform
- Filtered out incomplete or invalid records
- Standardized date formats and product names
- Aggregated sales by date, store, and product
- Calculated total sales, average sales, and quantity sold

### 3️⃣ Load
- Exported cleaned and aggregated data back to HDFS for analysis
